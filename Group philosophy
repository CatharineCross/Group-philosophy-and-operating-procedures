In this group we study the ethology of wild primates to gain a better understanding of their and our behaviuor and cognition. To do so we draw on biology, socio-ecology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, and more... We are holistic researchers.

Ethology is the process of 'interviewing' an animal * *in their own language* *(Tinbergen). Modern primate species are of interest to us in their own right. While they also provide a scaffold to understanding our own evolution, all species behavioural repertoires represent unique adaptations to their own particular niche. When we employ a uniquely anthropocentric perspective, we risk missing extraordinary species-specific capacities.
